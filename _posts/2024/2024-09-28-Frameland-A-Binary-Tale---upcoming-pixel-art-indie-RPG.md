[Frameland: A Binary Tale](https://frameland.net/) looks so cool! An indie rpg with a reto look and soundtrack and rich story is 100% my shit. I feel like it has so much of what made me really love Chained Echos.

it has yet to come out and I don't like to promote stuff that has not come out but indie studios need more suport so here I am. [Add it to your wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2137750/Frameland_A_Binary_Tale/)! I can't wait to buy this day 1!
